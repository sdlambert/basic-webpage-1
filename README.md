#### 04-11-2014 - Site Goals
These are some quick goals I jotted down. They will probably change as we move forward. They are in no particular order.

* Simple, quick-to-load and render
* Uniform style
* Add in features via:
  * Stuff I think is cool and can utilize immediately
  * Stuff Iâ€™m doing in school
  * Stuff I want to teach myself
* Utilize <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">HTML5 semantic elements</a>
* Organized file structures (images, maybe js and css too?)
* Learn and utilize github
* Content will be:
  * Plans for this page
  * School stuff (primarily for now)
  * Blog-style updates (static until I learn PHP)
  * Web Page progress, links to github
  * Hobbies
  * Portfolio
  * Contact/About Me
  * Archives for any/all above
* Start off simple, build slowly

#### 04-12-14 What I'm working on right now

* Boxy nav menu with hover color ange
* Make links in footer greyish, ylize
* ???

In unrelated news, I've discovered Sublime Text and I have fallen deeply in love.
