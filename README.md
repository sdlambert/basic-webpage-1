Basic Webpage 1
===============

Note: This was my first attempt at github, under my old user name which I've removed for personal reasons. I thought it would be fun to leave this here to see how far I've come.

## Hello world!

This is my first try at github!

My Github user page is at:
[Redacted]

My Github Pages repo can be found at:

You can see my homepage here:

#### 04-12-14 What I'm working on right now

* ~~Get menu and sections lined up~~
* ~~Boxy nav menu with hover color change~~
* ~~Added graphic to nav bar, left~~
* ~~Color!~~
* Make links in footer greyish, stylize
* graphics... how much do I want to do?

In unrelated news, I've discovered Sublime Text and I have fallen deeply in love.
